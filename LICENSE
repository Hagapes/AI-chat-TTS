## Use of Third-Party APIs

This project utilizes the Text-to-Speech (TTS) API from [Play.ht](https://play.ht/text-to-speech/) as a wrapper for audio generation. The API is not directly accessible to the public, and this project does not host or distribute the API itself. Instead, it integrates with the API to provide TTS functionality.

### Important Note

- The use of the Play.ht API is subject to their terms and conditions. This project does not attempt to replicate or distribute the API.
- The Google Generative AI API is utilized within this project and requires an API key for access. The script prompts users for their API key and does not store or expose it.

By using this project, you acknowledge that you are responsible for complying with the respective API providers' terms and conditions.
